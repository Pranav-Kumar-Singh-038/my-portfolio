            <p className=" text-stone-400 text-center px-96">I began my programming adventure during my academic years. Initially, making a 2-D platformer game piqued my interest, which led me to delve deeply into JavaScript. This experience helped me craft numerous dynamic applications, continuously honing my abilities and fostering a true passion for coding.

                Over time, I evolved from focusing solely on frontend development to becoming passionate about full-stack development, first immersing myself in React before delving into the complexities of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). While not coding, I enjoy reading books and spending quality time with family and friends.

                Currently, I am learning Next.js, TypeScript, and exploring Docker. This perfectly aligns with my dedication to continuous learning and keeping abreast of the rapidly changing programming landscape.
